# GitHub Pages deployment

The project workflow publishes the validated production build to GitHub Pages
after every push to `main`. Pull requests build and test the site, but they do
not upload a Pages artifact or run a deployment.

## Enable deployment

1. Open the repository's **Settings → Pages** page.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.
3. Open **Settings → Environments → github-pages** after its first appearance.
4. Restrict deployment branches to `main`. Add required reviewers when the site
   needs a manual production approval.

The build job has read-only repository access. The separate deployment job is
the only job granted `pages: write` and `id-token: write`, and it cannot begin
until the complete `Project` quality gate succeeds.

## Choose the public URL

Set `url` in `src/config/site.ts` to the complete public address. Forge derives
Astro's deployment base from this value, so canonical metadata, navigation,
assets, the RSS feed, the web manifest, and CMS branding use the same path.

For a project site, include the repository name:

```ts
url: 'https://owner.github.io/repository',
```

For an organization or user site, use the root address:

```ts
url: 'https://owner.github.io',
```

Run `npm run build && npm run validate:build` after changing the URL. Once the
workflow succeeds on `main`, its deployment summary links to the published site.

## Use a custom domain

Set the site URL to the custom origin without a repository pathname:

```ts
url: 'https://www.example.com',
```

Add `public/CNAME` containing only the domain name, configure the same domain in
**Settings → Pages**, and create the DNS records GitHub documents for the chosen
domain. The template does not include a `CNAME` file because generated projects
do not share a domain. Enable **Enforce HTTPS** after GitHub verifies the DNS
configuration.

Do not configure both a repository pathname and a custom domain. A custom domain
is served from its root, while a project site uses the repository name as its
base path.
